# Income Predictor Using 2021 ABS Census Data

## About

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict income categories based on features of age, sex, industry of employment, health condition, education, and Indigenous status. The dataset was sourced from the ABS 2021 Census data. The dataset was preprocessed, analyzed, and modeled using four classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (200NN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree. All models achieved similar accuracy levels of approximately 60%, with Random Forest and Decision Tree offering a balance between performance and efficiency. While SVM produced comparable results, it required significant computational time and a reduced dataset size. These findings highlight the trade-offs between model complexity, performance, and scalability in income classification tasks.
